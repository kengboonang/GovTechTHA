# GovTechTHA

Description:
Welcome to my repository for the GovTech Take-Home Assignment! This repository contains the code and process taken to cover the items in the later section. I apologise in advance for not using conventional frameworks and libraries for the frontend or not following conventional rules for the backend because my experience is with Data Science projects and not with those libraries. As I would still like to show what I've learnt and tried, I am using Streamlit instead as I usually do to quickly build and deploy PoCs for my projects. As for the backend, I have and will try my best to read up and try to employ the frameworks and libraries to the best of my abilities.

Contents:
- OpenAI API to interact with gpt-3.5-turbo
- Streamlit web application to converse with the LLM

How to Use:
1. Navigate to "src" and install requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. To load documentation, launch FastAPI using ```python -m uvicorn main:app --reload```
3. Documentation can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . 
4. To load chat interface, launch Streamlit using ```python -m streamlit run app.py```
5. Web interface should automatically load.

Requirements:

Python >= 3.8
Relevant Python libraries (FastAPI, Pydantic, Beanie, OpenAI)
